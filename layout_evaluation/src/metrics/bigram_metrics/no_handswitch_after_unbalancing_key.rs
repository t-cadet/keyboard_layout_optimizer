//! The bigram metric [`NoHandSwitchAfterUnbalancingKey`] assigns a cost to each bigram
//! that starts with an unbalancing key and ends on the same hand (no thumbs). The cost increases
//! with the square of the vertical distance. If the second key is unbalancing as well
//! and horizontally far away (more than three keys), the cost is increased even further.
